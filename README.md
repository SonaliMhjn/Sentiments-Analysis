In this project, I developed a Twitter Sentiment analysis tool using a logistic regression model. The tool classifies tweets as positive , negative or neutral based on their content. 
By training the model on labelled tweet data, it learns to identify sentiment-indicative features. 
The performance of the model is evaluated by comparing the predicted sentiment with the actual sentiment, allowing us to measure its accuracy and effectiveness in understanding public opinion on various topics
and classifies user sentiments accurately.
